# Installation

Start [Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/index.html) and enter the package mode by pressing `]`. You should see the prompt
```julia
(v1.1) pkg>
```
Type
```julia
(v1.1) pkg> dev https://github.com/newptcai/RandomTree.jl
```
should add `RandomTree.jl` to your default Julia environment. Then you can just use it as any other
Julia package. You can also find the source code of the package at `~/.julia/dev/RandomTree`.
